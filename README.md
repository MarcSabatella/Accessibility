# Accessibility

This is the repository for a variety of accessibility tools,
primarily relating to music notation.
At present, there are:

* JAWS scripts for MuseScore 3
* Orca scripts for MuseScore 3 (currently requires a development build of 3.5)

Coming soon I plan to provide a music21-based tool for translating MusicXML to Braille music
and potentially other resources.

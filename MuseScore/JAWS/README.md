# MuseScore JAWS Script

This script provides full support MuseScore using the JAWS screen reader.
To install, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/MarcSabatella/Accessibility/releases) tab,
then download and run "jfw_musescore.exe".
This will install the scripts in your local JAWS folder
as well as an uninstaller you can run to remove them should the need arise.

There are no special functions to learn in this JAWS script.
They merely help make sure MuseScore actually functions as expected with JAWS.
For more information on using the accessibility features in MuseScore,
see the [section on Accessibility in the MuseScore Handbook](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/accessibility).

We are very deeply indebted to [Peter Torpey](https://www.eyesonsuccess.net/) and [Doug Lee](http://www.dlee.org/)
for their assistance in developing this script!
